### FreshBot

- Current implementation is in FreshBot.py and is a work in progress.  
- User commands are in commands.py.  
- ChatGPT in chatGPT.py is a chatBot that is semi functional.  
- music.py is sourced from here: https://gist.github.com/EvieePy/ab667b74e9758433b3eb806c53a19f34 however it has been heavily modified.

## Key Features
- All 'stock-trading' channels that the bot has access to will be updated with the current price of the stock set if enabled.  
- Can play youtube videos and playlists. Also can search for songs.  
- Has chatting features utlizing chatGPT API.

## Updates
- Code has been converted from discord.client -> discord.bot -> discord.bot Interactions for better command functionality.  
- responses.py is now redundant, but there for legacy reasons.  

## Requirements
- Python  
- All requirements in requirements.txt  
- FFmpeg (This must be done manually as the requirements.txt has it, but will not work)
