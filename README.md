### FreshBot

- Current implementation is in FreshBot.py and is a work in progress.  
- User commands are in commands.py.  
- ChatGPT in chatGPT.py is a chatBot that is in the works.  
- music.py is sourced and is currently not my work. Its used for learning purposes and will be modified.  

## Key Features
- All 'stock-trading' channels that the bot has access to will be updated with the current price of the stock set.

## Updates
- Code has been converted from using discord.client to discord.bot for better functionality.  
- responses.py is now redundant, but there for legacy reasons.
